Passionate about aeronautics and astronautics, drones have become my favorite hobby. After learning to pilot a Mavic, I began building my own FPV drones. I spend hours designing, testing, and refining them based on their specific purposes. I use some for freestyle flying, larger ones—with the capability to carry cameras and fly long-range—for filming nature, and others optimized for racing.

Through this, I've gained a lot of knowledge about electronics and precise flight control, especially for racing. I still crash regularly, though! My drone frames are made of carbon fiber, with 3D-printed TPU protectors, but hitting a steel racing gate can still be pretty destructive. Maintenance and repair take quite a bit of time.

I'm always working to make my drones more efficient, whether by modifying carbon-fiber frames or enhancing them with custom Li-ion batteries.
