School project completed in 10th grade. This solar-powered Arduino boat is capable of autonomously collecting debris from the water surface using a net and rake. It can also record atmospheric data.
How I made it?  The main structure is built from 20x20 aluminum extrusions, supported by 2 floaters made of 6‚Äù PVC pipes, and propelled by 2 underwater propellers that steer using differential thrust. All electronics are protected in 2 separate waterproof plastic boxes: one containing the Arduino, receiver, and power distribution, and the other housing 2 6V lead batteries connected in series, along with the solar-powered MPPT.
