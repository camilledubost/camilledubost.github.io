For many of my UAVs (drones, fixed wings, and Capstone project), I built and used custom-assembled Li-ion batteries. These batteries are more energy-dense than the commonly used LiPo technology, providing UAVs with extended flight time. Additionally, at equal capacity, these custom-made batteries are more economical than off-the-shelf options. Building these batteries required precision and attention to avoid wiring errors. The downside of Li-ion batteries is their lower power output (Amps), which provides less thrust and doesnâ€™t handle rapid power surges well. For the Capstone drone, I made two 4S2P packs (photos below) and connected them in parallel to increase the current from 45A to 90A, effectively doubling the capacity.
