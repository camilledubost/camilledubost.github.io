Building a small plane had been a dream of mine since I began exploring electronics and UAVs.
 
I created multiple prototypes with bodies made from either foam or 3D-printed plastic parts. After refining and detailing 8 3D designs using Onshape CAD software, my latest prototype has a streamlined shape to allow for easy add-ons. It is a twin-motor plane with a V-tail, a wingspan of 130 cm, and weighs 800 grams without electronics. I printed it in PLA+ but plan to test lightweight PLA soon. This latest prototype took flight in August 2024.
